# EDA-Analysis
Hello! Welcome to my presentation and exploratory data analysis on a company whose regional sales we're analyzing.

Here we will dive deeper into data pertaining to sales, population, performance by year, warehouse, or region, and more.

We will make charts and graphs to visualize the answers to questions we have about this company's performance.

The period this data covers is from 2014 through 2017, and it covers most of the United States of America.

We'll glean valuable insights from this data, and we'll make recommendations to improve sales performance.

As you read through the PowerPoint presentation and the Python notebook, I hope you enjoy this analysis.
